➔ **Quick Setup & Hardening Windows tool.**<br/>
In my current role as a **systems and network administrator** and as a **cybersecurity student** building my own homelab, I regularly find myself **manually configuring and reinstalling Windows** setups _from scratch_.<br/><br/>
While many similar tools exist, none to date has automated every step as cleanly and comprehensively as neodesk (neo for “new,” Win for “Windows,” & Winzard).
<br/>

<br/>
neodesk is a lightweight Windows 11 utility actually in developpement in Python, Bach & PowerShell. 
<br/><br/>


➔ It provides a simple GUI to automate every step of your **initial setup customization, security hardening, system debloat, and silent installation.**<br/>

## 🚀 Functionalities
✅ **Debloatware** – Remove built-in bloat <br/>
✅ **Configuration** – Tweak UI, privacy, power settings and customization <br/>
✅ **Installation** – Massive silent app installer <br/>
✅ **Security** – Apply hardening policies <br/>
✅ **System Info** – Live hardware summary <br/>

and the more interesting one :  <br/>
💥 Builder .exe/.msi – Create a custom installer with your settings for automated and silent installation <br/>
<br/><br/>
